1. Hello World

	#### Objectives
	Learn how to source a JavaScript file. Learn how to console log values and see the results. Both are essential to testing out any JavaScript concepts you learn. 

	JavaScript is a programming language. It will be the base language that we use throughout this course. The fundamental programming concepts are the essential building blocks to building a full featured application. 
	- For now let's make a folder on your desktop called hello-world.
	- Open folder up you code editor. At Prime we will use [Atom](https://atom.io/). You can do this by dragging the folder over the atom icon in your dashboard.
	- Make two new files: index.html and script.js. Mention file extensions (js and html). Things might look different, you won't have file icons yet.
	- Code basic html page. html head and body. Test by opening in finder. Show the file path in URL. We use chrome. Comments in HTML.
	- Code basic script file. Comments in JS. Can't test until we source.
	- Source the script file. Meaning make the HTML aware of the JS file. JavaScript isn't require, but makes our pages do cool things. script tag. src attribute takes a path to the file.
	- file system.
	- Test that they are sourced.
	- Log hello world.

	#### Try it! 
Make the classic "Hello World" program. Scrub back through the video and follow along. Challenge: Append to the DOM.

2. Variable
	**What is a variable?** - *Variables are containers that you can store values in.* - MSDN
	
	**Example**: While talking through following points, so the creation of a variable, assignment, reassignment, and logging it out.
	
	**Declaration** - The key word *var* followed by the name of the container or variable.
	
	**Assign it** - Give it value, with the assignment operator = followed by the value you want the container to hold.
	
	**Reassign it**
	
	**Example**: Let's change our Hello World from Tau to a specific person. First we could 'hard code' this (meaning a string of the name we want), but this doesn't really solve our problem because now instead of saying Tau every time it says Fred. We want that portion to be variable based on the user input. Simple way to get user input is the prompt method.
	
	**Why use a variable?** - The reassignment is important. This gives use the ability to make functionality that is generalized and can preform the same tasks on different input (variables). 
	
	#### Try it! 
	Modify the code you wrote after the 'Hello World' video to take user input and console log the value.
