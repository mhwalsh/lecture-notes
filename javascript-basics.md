	#### Objectives
	Learn how to source a JavaScript file. Learn how to console log values and see the results. Both are essential to testing out any JavaScript concepts you learn. 

	JavaScript is a programming language. It will be the base language that we use throughout this course. The fundamental programming concepts are the essential building blocks to building a full featured application. 
	- For now let's make a folder on your desktop called hello-world.
	- Open folder up you code editor. At Prime we will use [Atom](https://atom.io/). You can do this by dragging the folder over the atom icon in your dashboard.
	- Make two new files: index.html and script.js. Mention file extensions (js and html). Things might look different, you won't have file icons yet.
	- Code basic html page. html head and body. Test by opening in finder. Show the file path in URL. We use chrome. Comments in HTML.
	- Code basic script file. Comments in JS. Can't test until we source.
	- Source the script file. Meaning make the HTML aware of the JS file. JavaScript isn't require, but makes our pages do cool things. script tag. src attribute takes a path to the file.
	- file system.
	- Test that they are sourced.
	- Log hello world.
