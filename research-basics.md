### How to Research

- Looking for good/trusted sources
	- mozilla developer network
	- stack overflow
	- w3 schools as we are learning
	- developer blogs/tutorials can be good
- when searching
	- technology + problem
- I like to bookmark good links
- Start taking note of the places and types of help work best for you so you can expedite the process.
- Share with classmates - we could make a resources and notes channel Thoughts?

### Browser Fu
- cmd t to open a new tab
- cntrl click to open in a new tab
- flip through tabs
- cmd w to close a tab

#### Stackover flow
- probably not worth it to become a stackover flow guru.
- if you cant find your question, ask!
- looking at answers make sure it is the accepted answer and/or has a lot of votes not always the same thing
